## Presentation

Approach adopted : Function based component </br>
To do so, i needed hooks, they were added to React in version 16.8, i had to upgrade the version of react
### Added Tools 

- [React v16.8 (the one with hooks)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react/v/16.8.0)
- [react-feather (for Search icon)](https://feathericons.com/)
- [use-debounce (for debouncing callbacks)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-debounce)
- [react-input-range (input range UI for Testing purpose)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-input-range)
- [react-icons (for Spinner icon )] (https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
- [react-content-loader (for loading the svg Skeletton)](https://github.com/danilowoz/react-content-loader)

### Steps

1. Display paginated users list 
    - Load paginated data  ***(done)***
    - Display data table   ***(done)***
    - Test your components  ***(in progress)***
2. Display quick search bar
    - Display search bar autocomplete input ***(done)***
    - Load data on change ***(done)***
    - Test your components ***(in progress)***




## Display paginated users list
Instead of making a component UI based on raw static data that is coming from a JSON, i prefred to do the job like if it was a real world situation.
I mean by that, what if we were expecting data coming from an API and we needed to interact with it asynchronously instead of synchronously ? 

The solution was to transform the payload to a promise object through 
```js 
 TransformToPromise(payload : array)
``` 
Function located at  [/src/App/UI/Users/List/utils.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/utils.js) file.

To simulate internet speed latency i used
```js 
 sleep(someValue : int)
``` 
function located at  [/src/App/UI/Users/List/utils.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/utils.js) file.
## Added Scripts under /src/App/UI/Users/List folder.
### lib.js
here i created all my styled-comppnents. <br/>
File located at [/src/App/UI/Users/List/lib.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/lib.js)

### customHooks.js 
Here i created all my customHooks .<br/>
File  located at [/src/App/UI/Users/List/customHooks.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/customHooks.js)

### list.js 
here i consume all components created at **lib.js** .<br/>
File located at [/src/App/UI/Users/List/list.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/list.js)

### index.js 
The final result :).<br/>
File located at [/src/App/UI/Users/List/index.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/index.js).<br/>
if you wonder why i surround dispatch comming from Props with  useSafeDispatch(dispatch) ?
it's for avoiding setState warnings on unmounted React components here is an amazing video made by the amazing instructor Kent C.Dodds
explaining why we need to do so : ***https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BNdxFzMeVg&t=221s*** .

To replicate the warning follow these steps : 
1. comment line 18 
2. uncomment line 20 in same file
3. open the app in via the command: ***npm start*** or ***npm run start***
4. click Button Next & toggle the checkbox before users load 
5. and voil√† you get the warning

the latest version of react stop checking if a component is mounted source : **https://medium.com/doctolib/react-stop-checking-if-your-component-is-mounted-3bb2568a4934**



## Display quick search bar


## Added Scripts under /src/App/UI/Users/Search folder.
component support  keydown ,keyUp and Enter

### search.js

Here you find the UI available in [/src/App/UI/Users/Search/search.js](./src/App/UI/Users/Search/search.js).</br>
Since it is a small component i decided to keep the created styled-component objects in the same file.</br>
The input and icon are well centred horizontally and vertically and  available in 3 variants  small, medium, large.

### VisuallyHidden.js

Visually Hidden is used when an element needs to be available to assistive technology, but otherwise hidden. The visually hidden component hides text visually from screen, but keeps it available to assistive technologies, such as screen readers. The component shouldn't be used to hide interactive content.</br> 
File located at [/src/App/UI/Users/Search/VisuallyHidden.js](./src/App/UI/Users/Search/VisuallyHidden.js)


### constants.js

just for fun instead of using colors provided by 
```js
 <StyledComponentsThemeProvider theme={theme}/>
 ```
provider,</br>
i decided to save my own colors in this file, then use them for styling my components.</br>
File located at [/src/App/UI/Users/Search/constants.js](./src/App/UI/Users/Search/constants.js)

### icon.js

Here i create the icon component, thank's to 'react-feather' library.</br>
File located  at [/src/App/UI/Users/Search/icon.js](./src/App/UI/Users/Search/icon.js)

### lib.js

where i create some Wrappers .
File located at [/src/App/UI/Users/Search/icon.js](./src/App/UI/Users/Search/lib.js)

### customHooks.js
Here i created all my customHooks .<br/>
File located at [/src/App/UI/Users/Search/customHooks.js](./src/App/UI/Users/Search/customHooks.js)

### index.js

where everything above is consumed.

# React test for SMART-TRIBUNE

## Presentation

Here is a bootstrapped project oriented to test developers integration skills.  
This **React** project already load some packages like **redux**, **material-ui**, or **styled-components**, that are the technological stack in use for some existing projects at Smart-Tribune.  

You should be able to integrate some components, including unit tests, listed below.  
Api mocks, redux actions, and reducers have already been implemented to let you focus on integration.  
You could see them under the [Application](./src/App/Application) folder.

### Steps

1. Display paginated users list
    - Load paginated data
    - Display data table
    - Test your components
2. Display quick search bar
    - Display search bar autocomplete input
    - Load data on change
    - Test your components
3. _(Bonus)_ Use infinite scroll to display users

### Tools

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- [Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/)
- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
- [Enzyme](https://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/api/)

### Constraints

For this test, we do **not allow**:

- jQuery
- .css files

## Display paginated users list
### Where to implement this
You will find the base List component as [index.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/index.js) under [/src/App/UI/Users/List](./src/App/UI/Users/List) folder.

### Load paginated data
To load users, your component should call:
```js 
dispatch(fetchUsers(new FetchUsers(page: number, perPage: number)));
```
This will update the `UsersListView` object avaialable through `users` prop.

### Test those components
Write some jest/enzyme tests to make sure your components will work properly.

### Expected result
This will display a paginated list of user cards.

Go https://wireframe.cc/FV6WsI to see the expected result.  
Hovering the red dotted zones will make annotations appear.

With this integration, we will take a special look on alignement respect, responsivity, and cross browser compatibility (IE 11 +).  
Your tests will also been focused, to let us know how you consider that things are just well tested. 

## Display quick search bar
### Where to implement this
You will find the base Search component as [index.js](./src/App/UI/Users/List/index.js) under [/src/App/UI/Users/Search](./src/App/UI/Users/Search) folder.

### Load data
To filter users, your component should call:
```js 
dispatch(filterUsers(new FilterUsers(filter: string, maxResults: number)));
```
This will update the `Array<UserView>` array avaialable through `users` prop.

### Test those components
Write some jest/enzyme tests to make sure your components will work properly.

### Expected result
This will display a search bar with autocomplete input.

Go https://wireframe.cc/FV6WsI to see the expected result.  
Hovering the red dotted zones will make annotations appear.

This input + icon have to be **centered horizontally and vertically**.

## _(Bonus)_ Use infinite scroll to display users list

Humm, pagination is not really user friendly, maybe we should use infinite scroll ?  
Sure, but you will have to look at some additionnal packages to make it work, right ?
